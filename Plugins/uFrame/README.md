* Bootstrap the game in a manageable manner
* Provide the supported architecture with useful utilities, mainly:
 - Reactive Extensions (UniRX Framework)
 - Dependency Injection (Zenject Framework)
 - Type-Safe Event Aggregation
 - Scene Management via Promise-like approach


## Philosophy

* No Magic
* Minimalism at the core but flexibility for the seeking
